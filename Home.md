RHadoop is a collection of three R packages that allow users to manage and analyze data in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The packages have been implemented and tested in Cloudera's distribution of Hadoop (CDH3) with R 2.13.0.
RHadoop consists of the following packages:

* rmr: functions providing Hadoop MapReduce functionality in R.
* rhdfs: functions providing file management of the HDFS from within R.
* rhbase: functions providing database management for the HBase distributed database from within R.
