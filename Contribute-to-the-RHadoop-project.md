###Contact Us
We are interested in help with any of the following:

* Documentation (see also [[Documentation Guidelines for rmr]])
* R examples
* Core code development 

We follow the [fork+pull](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) collaboration model. Please add an issue to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/issues) or comment on an existing one to describe what you intend to do. This is to stimulate community input and increase the chances of your patch being accepted. Please don't ask to pull into master as we can not accept code there without testing. Hit *Change Commits* and select a different base ("into") branch, could be dev or a relevant feature branch. 

For any questions, feel free to reach us at rhadoop@revolutionanalytics.com or to participate in out [Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en-US&fromgroups#!forum/rhadoop).
