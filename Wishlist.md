Do you have wishes to add to RHadoop wishlist below? Is there something youâ€™d like to see in the next release? Let us know!

Please enter a new issue into one of the issue trackers ([rhdfs](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rhdfs/issues), [rhbase](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rhbase/issues), [rmr2](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2/issues)) or email them to rhadoop@revolutionanalytics.com.  

Better yet, [[contribute to the RHadoop project]], and make this wishlist a reality!!

### Current Wishlist
* Add more examples
* Mahout integration (mainly for data format compatibility, since the two systems have different purposes)
* Pig "modules" that call R (for example, allowing the user to compute a quantile using R, from Pig, using Pig notation).
* Mesos/Spark integration (additional rmr backend?).
