If you have specific suggestions for our wishlist please email them to rhadoop@revolutionanalytics.com.  Better yet, become a contributor to this project, and make this wishlist a reality!!

###Wishes
* Add more examples
* Mahout integration (mainly for exchanging analyses, since both systems are different)
* Pig "modules" that call R (for example, allowing the user to compute a quantile using R, from Pig, using Pig notation).
* Mesos/Spark integration.
