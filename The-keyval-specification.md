The central data type for rmr is the key-value pair. It is a list of any two R objects with an attribute "rmr.keyval" set to TRUE, created with the `keyval` function. Data sets in mapreduce are seen as collections of key-value pairs. There is an alternate way to represent data sets which is the vectorized key-value pair, which is created with the same `keyval` function with a third argument `vectorized` set to TRUE and has an "rmr.vectorized" attr set to TRUE. This means that the key and value are construed as collection of elementary keys and rows resp. In this case a key or value can be an atomic vector, atomic matrix or data frame with atomic columns. If it has rows ( `nrow` doesn't return NULL), then each row `[i,]` is considered a key, otherwise each element as returned by `\[[i]]`, `i` an integer within the appropriate range. The same is true for values. The number of elementary keys and values in a pair has to be the same. The reason vectorized key-value pairs exist is efficiency. It's a lot faster to call `keyval(1:10^6, 1:10^6)` than `lapply(1:10^6, function(i) keyval(i,i))`, namely 163 times faster on some systems. For the same reason, vectorized key-value pairs are serialized using a simple serialization format called *typedbytes* instead of R's own format, which doesn't have support for matrices and data frames.
